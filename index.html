<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Kyle Stockton and I am an aspiring junior developer in the Portland, OR area. 
I specialize in C#, particularly ASP.NET and Unity3D, but I'm also familiar with 
JavaScript, Sass, SQL, HTML, and Clojure. 
This site is brand new, so please check back later for new developments. 
In the meantime, feel free to contact me at kylestockton@mail.com.
